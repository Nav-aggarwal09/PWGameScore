# PWGameScore
This is the repo for the Game Scoring Application for Pinewood. 
Worked on collaborativley with small group. 

## What it was used for
As of 2018, there is no way of checking the score for Pinewood Highschool's sports games. 
Those that are not physically at a particular game or match will not know what is going on unless a classmate notifies them. 
This aimed to eliminate that by having all the stats (score, time, timeouts, etc) all online. 

A designated recorder would login with the credentials and would have the ability to 
update the stats while everyone else can see what's going on live.
